# Venice Boat Classification
## Introduction
This is an analysis of different kinds of boat navigating the canals and lagoon of Venice, Italy. The boats are classified according to their design, function, and propulsion method. 
The boats range from gondolas to workboats like sandoli and bragozzi. Gondolas are known for their asymmetrical shape and elegant design. They are mainly used for tourism and ceremonial purposes. Other boats such as the vaporetto (water bus) and traghetto (ferry gondola) serve public transportation needs across the cityâ€™s waterways.
The train dataset contains 1969 images while the test dataset contains 4774 images.
